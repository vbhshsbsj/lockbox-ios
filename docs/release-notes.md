# Release Notes

## 1.3 (Build 2259)

You now have the ability to automatically fill your username and password into apps and websites.

Be sure to enable AutoFill after updating to iOS 12 in "Settings" under the "Passwords & Accounts" section.

## 1.2 (Build 2016)

_Date: 2018-08-27_

**PLEASE NOTE: YOU MAY EXPERIENCE A CRASH!** We're aware of an issue when you open the app it immediately crashes (and are working to gather more data and fix it). If this does happen, please re-open the app and continue testing everything else from there. Thank you!

It's been a month since our launch and we've been working hard to replace the old way of logging in with Firefox Accounts and fixing some bugs. For new users, they'll encounter a smoother and clearer experience. For existing users with the app already installed, you'll just need to sign in once again.

Here's the full list of changes:

- Introduced the OAuth login flow to replace the "old" way of signing in
- Added a "migration path" so users with the app sign back in and store data properly
- The app clears your local storage and cache when you disconnect your account
- You can now "pull to refresh" to force a sync when looking at an empty list
- We fixed some alignment bugs for iPhone SEs running iOS 10
- The autolock feature has been hardened as to when and how it locks the app
- The app no longer dynamically adjusts the navigation bar sizes so it can be usable
- If you type a very long search term you can "Cancel" and clear it as expected now
- We improved the small arrows next to links
- You can now "Ask a Question" from the settings screen to contact us directly

Thanks to all our open source contributors that helped make this release possible.

## 1.1.1 (Build 1717)

_Date: 2018-07-26_

It's been two weeks since our initial public launch, and one week since we opened up to all countries. Thanks to everyone's feedback we have some minor changes and bug fixes for you in this update.

We made some changes to autolocking and want your help testing it! Please let us know if you find anything unexpected.

We also added Klar as a browser option instead of Focus, when available. Can all you German users with Klar installed please make sure it works OK?

Here's the full list of changes:

- The autolock timer pauses when on a webpage so it doesn't lock when submitting feedback or reading FAQs
- Updated the app icon to an improved version
- You can pick Klar as your preferred browser (instead of Focus) if its available on your device
- We added the app version to the settings screen and feedback survey so we can know what you're running
- Fixed a visual bug on the "Preferred Browser" table
- Added ability to "Lock Now" for users without a device passcode set
- Added more autolock timer options: 15 and 30 minutes
- Fixed a Firefox Account bug related to server configuration
- Fixed it so you return to the "Confirm Your Email" state and screen even if your app fully quits instead of starting everything over

Please note: we intentionally skipped from version 1.0 all the way to 1.1.1 for various reasons.

## 1.0 (Build 1128)

_Date: 2018-05-14_

This build DOES include: signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox; automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data; searching and sorting items; showing/hiding passwords; copying usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds); opening web addresses in your preferred web browser; Telemetry for event tracking (no personally-identifiable information is collected).

This build DOES NOT include: user-friendly item titles (#193); links to real FAQ content (#172 and #340); proper visual placeholders when an initial sync is occurring (#233) or when no items are found (#44).

Some KNOWN ISSUES include: you may sign in and get a "confirmation" email, the app doesn't tell you that you need to go find that email so your list appears empty - go find that email and "Confirm" your sign ins, please (#328); the autolock timer doesn't automatically lock your app (#356); when navigating away from the list view and a sync occurs in the background the app will pop you back into the list view (#347); the search/filter keyboard is immediately dismissed after the first and second character you type (#351). Don't worry, we'll get these fixed soon!

Please also note: the app may crash on first run — just open it again and please let us know if you encounter this or anything unexpected. We believe we squashed all kinds of bugs related to first run and sign in but need your help making sure.
